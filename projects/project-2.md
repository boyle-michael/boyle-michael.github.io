My first year at UL, I aided in the development of an internal program used by engineers for data input. I learned how to program in D-script and how to successfully share my changes to the company GitHub repository. In addition to D-script, I learned HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Part of the project required translation of original forms to HTML forms usable by the program. 

During my second year at UL, I was in charge of programming a drone to perform autonomous security routes. In addition to the security routes, the drone was used to record both standard footage and spherical footage of the campus. The spherical footage was used to create a virtual reality tour of both the inside and outside of the building. After the shots were recorded, it was my responsibility to edit and the various clips using iMovie.
