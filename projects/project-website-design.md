As a part of a web design class in high school, I created a full fledged website that showcased current and past projects as well as a bio and a few of my interests. The website had 7 pages of content and was published for about a year before I stopped paying for hosting.

The main focus of the class was on the design aspect of the website. For example: "Does it look nice?", "Does it load fast?", "Is it user friendly?". I learned about optimizing storage space and image size/resolution on website to speed up loading times. I also got experience hosting a website using <a href="https://www.hostgator.com/">Host Gator</a>. I was also able to reinforce my skills with HTML and CSS by using them in practice.
