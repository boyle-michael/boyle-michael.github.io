## What is Bounce Boy?
Bounce Boy is my very first app. It is a simple physics-based game where you try to bounce Bounce Boy as many times as possible. You can keep Bounce Boy in the air by moving the ball under him. As your score increases, the gravity increases as well. New characters can be unlocked by reaching high enough scores. The game generated revenue by showing ads using the now discontinued iAds. 

## The Creation Process
I created this game entirely from scratch using Apple's Xcode and the Swift programming language. I also had to become familiar with SpriteKit which is used to make 2D games in Xcode. All of the art assets were drawn by me using GIMP. The game took around six months to complete and publish to the App Store. 

I learned a lot about programming when making this game. I was taking AP Computer Science in my Sophomore year in high school at the time and Swift was the second language I learned (right after Java). I taught myself how to do everything in the project from learning Swift to using Xcode to jumping through the hoops to publish the game. I learned how to test the in-app purchases and ads in a sandbox environment. I even got a little better at graphic design and animations. Creating such a simple game by myself made me really appricate the work companies put into their big title games.
