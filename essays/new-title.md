## The Best Way to Solve the Rubik's Cube

Problems tend to get easier over time. Humans are hardwired to notice patterns that aid us in completing things more efficiently. For example, way back when calculus when people were learning calculus and they discovered what derivatives are, they probably noticed after many attempts that there are rules that shorten the calculation signicantly. Similarly, when the Rubik's Cube first came out, no one could Google the answer; there were no robots that solved it using some cleverly design algorithms. Instead, someone fiddled around with it until they solved it. And then they solved it again, and again, and again, until they noticed that they could solve it the same way every single time. Unless a piece was twisted and the Rubik's Cube was unsolvable, the method that was refined over time was sure to get the job done. The moral of the story is: next time you want to solve a Rubik's Cube, don't reinvent the wheel, just look up others did it. 

### How does this relate?

Like any other problem, Software Engineering followed this same pattern. Some very smart people tried and tried again. Each time evolving there past method of design until we have come to the many modern day design patterns. Rubik's Cube algorithms and software engineering design patterns are not all that different. For example, the method described on the Rubik's Cube website is a sure thing to solve the problem, but it is not necessarily the most efficient. Likewise, the use of classes and objects can get the job done in object oriented programming, but there could be better ways. For Rubik's Cube, there are speed solving algorithms. You have to learn a lot more algorithms and be able to recognize when to use each of them, but you will solve it much faster. For software engineering, the use of the Factory Method is comparable to speed solving. It has the advantages of being able to return objects from other classes, returning multiple objects, or even build additional, dependent objects. However, it comes at the cost of being more complicated than using an object oriented class constructor. 

### The Easier Way

In web development, Semantic UI is the Costco sized pack of cookie cutters. Every type of cookie cutter is there and can be manipulated to look as desired. The smaller tweaks to the Semantic UI components are like the frosting and sprinkles. They are not necessary, because the content is all there, but they add flavor and aesthetic appeal. By adding a UI framework like Semantic UI to the development process, you will not only speed up your work, but you see better results in less time. Simple class manipulations from a pre-existing library and a few easy CSS tweaks can result in professional looking websites with less than a couple hours of work. After working with cookie cutters, it is unlikely that I will ever go back to using a butter knife and toothpick.
