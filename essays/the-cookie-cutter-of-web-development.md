## Trying to Make the Perfect Cookies

Making a website is a lot like baking cookies. You have to have all the base content mixed together and settled before you start to shape the website into its final form. Once you have rolled out all the details, it is time to split all the content into pages. Not just any pages but beautiful pages that take up as much of the content as possible. One way to do this is to use a knife and carefully cut each page out with as much precision as possible. The easier way to ensure the pages look like what you want is to simply use a cookie cutter. 

### The Easier Way

In web development, Semantic UI is the Costco sized pack of cookie cutters. Every type of cookie cutter is there and can be manipulated to look as desired. The smaller tweaks to the Semantic UI components are like the frosting and sprinkles. They are necessary, because the content is all there, but they add flavor and aesthetic appeal.

### Plain HTML and CSS

Trying to build a website using only plain HTML and CSS is like cutting the dough with dough with a butter knife and spreading the frosting with a toothpick. Eventually, you could get what you want, but it will take forever and the work will not be easy. By adding a UI framework like Semantic UI to the development process, you will not only speed up your work, but you see better results in less time. Simple class manipulations from a pre-existing library and a few easy CSS tweaks can result in professional looking websites with less than a couple hours of work. After working with cookie cutters, it is unlikely that I will ever go back to using a butter knife and toothpick.
