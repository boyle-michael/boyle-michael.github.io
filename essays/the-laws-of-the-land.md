## The Elusive Green Check

I try and I try but no matter how precise I am, the little green check avoids my gaze. I review my work and everything looks correct. I run my program and everything works just the way it was intended to. Yet, the elusive green check still will not reveal itself. I have given up on doing things manually, so I press the button to make the changes that ESLint has given me. Poof! My entire program looks different. Something I did not know was broke, is now fixed. Finally, the little green check sits perched in the top right of the editor. But was it worth all the trouble?

### Learning From Failure (...or partial failure)

While everything I have learned about coding standards and programming is displayed in perfect harmony on the screen, IntelliJ IDEA insists that there are problems with my code. When I make the change, my first thought is, "Well that was dumb, my way worked too." My way did work, it acomplished the job and it was something I understood and could repeat. But the way the editor chose to change it showed me something new. I would have never done it that way. The code is even more concise. It is easier to read. It just plain looks nicer. Thanks to these coding standards, I now know how to do the same thing in two different ways. Even if one is preferred over the other, knowledge is something that is meant to be accumulated.
