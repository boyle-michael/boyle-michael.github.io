I have a fascination for how things work. When I was a toddler, my mom took me to a merry-go-round. While all of the other kids smiled and laughed, I sat quietly and stared intently at the ceiling where the pole entered. After the ride, I told my mom exactly how the horses were able to move up and down. My fascination carried on into the future and peaked when I started using computers.

Programming an application was a goal that obsessed me since the sixth grade. Many times, I tried to learn on my own, and each time I made little progress before hitting a wall. In middle school, I developed simple games using a drag and drop program in my advanced technology class. It was a start, but I wasn’t satisfied. Freshman year, I took robotics. It was one of my favorite classes. The instructor gave us a box of pieces, tasks to complete and left us to our own devices. It taught me how to use my resources and problem solve.

When I enrolled in AP Computer Science, I finally learned how to code using Javascript. It came easily to me because I think very similar to the way programming works. Once I had that solid foundation, I started teaching myself Swift and the Xcode IDE. By the end of the year, I had a working application and was proficient in two programming languages. As time went on, I continued to expand my programming toolbox. I taught myself a variety of other languages and explored game development in the Unity Game Engine. My experience landed me two internships in which I could use and improve on my coding skills. During my internships I learned about website development and actively used D-script to develop a program used by their engineers for data input. 

Computer science has changed the way I see the world. I observe the world in a way where I see everything as something that could be emulated on a computer. I am looking forward to a career in computer science.

Currently, I don’t know where I want my degree in computer science to take me. I have dabbled around with a few different uses such as databases, website development, and mobile app development, but I don’t want to limit myself to just one before I experience everything your school has to offer.

Work isn’t really work if you love doing it. That’s why computer science is perfect for me. I won’t get tired of it and I will always put my best foot forward. I am looking forward to starting my future at your prestigious institution.
