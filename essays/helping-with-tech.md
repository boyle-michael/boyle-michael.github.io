Technology is something that I (and most other people) use on a daily basis. It is because of this reason that I think technology is so fascinating. Most people use the technology but very few people actually understand how it works. Obviously I was drawn to the inner workings of technology from a young age, and I wanted to help spread the knowledge. 

During my freshman year, I teamed up with my robotics teacher to introduce the basics of robotics and programming to third graders at a local elementary school. We used a basic version of Lego Mindstorm robots to demonstrate. The students were split into groups by their table groups and, just like my experience in class, given the parts and instructions and were sent on their way. Of course, my teacher and I walked around the class to help when help was needed. The students loved it and that made me love it even more. Over the course of a week, we visited all of the the third grade classes a couple times each. Hopefully my enthusiasm for technology rubbed off on them and will have a positive impact on their lives.

Another way that I hope I have helped my community is by providing entertainment. When I programmed a game and published it on the App Store, I made it completely free to play. Although I lost money in the process the joy of seeing students within my high school competing for a high score made it all worth it.
