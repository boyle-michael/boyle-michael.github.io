Camas High School offers a unique program known as the Magnet in Science & Technology (MST) program. Each year, 30 of the brightest students are selected through an application process not dissimilar to a college application. Magnet students are enrolled in more challenging courses and provided with internship and research opportunity. Through the MST program, I have done two semesters of research: one on the effects of UV-C light on E. coli and the other on integrated learning practices. The next year, I taught myself to program and developed an iOS application. My last two years were spent interning at Underwriters Laboratories. 

My first year at UL, I aided in the development of an internal program used by engineers for data input. I learned how to program in D-script and how to successfully share my changes to the company GitHub repository. In addition to D-script, I learned HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Part of the project required translation of original forms to HTML forms usable by the program. 

During my second year at UL, I was in charge of programming a drone to perform autonomous security routes. In addition to the security routes, the drone was used to record both standard footage and spherical footage of the campus. The spherical footage was used to create a virtual reality tour of both the inside and outside of the building. After the shots were recorded, it was my responsibility to edit and the various clips using iMovie.
